# HTTP Harness for Node.js API Development

**Copyright (C) 2016 David Betz**

## Purpose

Put simply: **to aid in building Node.js HTTP APIs**

Testing HTTP tests too much and creating a fake endpoint doesn't actually help you develop your endpoint. Just build the `req` and `res` and be done with it.

## Usage

Just look at the tests.
